# ERC_inflow_outflow

Repository to hold the ERC data and the plot of the attractiveness of EU countries in term of ERC grantees. \
**In the first version of the plot that was circulated there was a honest but terrible mistake, I mistook the country code "IL" to mean Ireland -- but it means Israel**. \
This repo contains the correct script & plot, but also the bad ones in a hall of shame to remind my future self of triple-checking before tweeting.

## Dependencies

The script depends on `tidyverse` and several `ggplot` extensions -- nothing else

## Data

Data were shared by the ERC based on official ERC data, aggregated over several years to ensure the privacy of PIs.

## Tweet 

The plot has been share on Twitter here: <https://twitter.com/PaoloCrosetto/status/1601543398200311809?s=20&t=FFxWHl2U2w82rdXMsbI8Tw>

## Correct plots
